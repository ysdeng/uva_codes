The file is a part of problem 1019.  
  
## problem 1019 ac  
First, I need to ensure the origin input is unpolluted.  
Second, I need to initialize the switches' state each time.  
  
## problem 1018 ac  
This is a spacial case of MST.  
Be careful about the boundary.  
  
## problem 1021 ac  
This is a simple simulation problem.  
  
## problem 1020 ac  
It's a simple recursive problem.  
  
## problem 1022 ac  
use plain sweeping to solve this problem  
  
## problem 1025 ac  
simple DP  
  
## problem 1024 ac  
simple, tedious  
  
## problem 1026 ac  
simple math, binary search
