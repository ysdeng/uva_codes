Practice big_num_divisionAndMultiplication.c  
The file is a part of problem 1019.  
  
problem 1019 wa:    
Decide the first switch ON or OFF, then i can settle rest.  
However, there are still some bugs that need to be figured out.  
  
##20170302
problem 1019 ac:  
First, I need to ensure the origin input is unpolluted.  
Second, I need to initialize the switches' state each time.

problem 1018 start:  
This is a spacial case of MST.

problem 1018 re:  
I don't know what's wrong.  
   
problem 1018 ac:

Be careful about the boundary.

problem 1021 start:  
This is a simple simulation problem.

problem 1020 wa:  
floating point precision

problem 1020 ac:  
after a week... It's a simple recursive problem.  
  
##20170323  
problem 1022 tle:  
1. find edge: (v/4)^2 * (v/4)^2  
2. move cover to contact hole: v  
3. sort all x & y: vlg(v)  
4. plane sweeping: v^2  
time complexity: v^5* ( vlg(v) + v^2)
